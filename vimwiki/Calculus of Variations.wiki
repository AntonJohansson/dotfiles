== Euler Lagrange ==
	* Euler's approach
		- Approximate function with line-segments.
		- Approximate functional as as finite sum
		- What is the effect of varying one of the free vertices
		  in the y-direction?
		- let n -> inf giving EL
	* Lagrange's approach
		- Introduce small variation h(x) to funciton y(x)
		- measure diff. in J[y+h]-J[y] in weak or strong norm
		- taylor expand
		- expression for the first variation
		- dJ = 0 gives expression which implies EL due to
		  the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations
